# HMR Debug Information

## Fixed Issues

### TypeError: Failed to fetch in webpack HMR

**Problem**: Webpack Hot Module Replacement was failing with fetch errors, possibly due to network connectivity issues in the cloud environment.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Added webpack configuration in `next.config.mjs` to handle HMR failures gracefully
2. Configured error overlay to show only errors (not warnings)
3. Enabled automatic reconnection for webpack dev client
4. Added infrastructure logging level to reduce noise

**Configuration Added**:
```javascript
webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
  if (dev && !isServer) {
    config.infrastructureLogging = {
      level: 'error',
    }
    
    // Add fallback for webpack hmr failures
    if (config.devServer) {
      config.devServer.client = {
        overlay: {
          errors: true,
          warnings: false,
        },
        reconnect: true,
      }
    }
  }
  return config
}
```

## Additional Debugging Options

If HMR issues persist, you can set these environment variables:

```bash
# Enable detailed webpack logging
DEBUG=webpack*

# Disable HMR entirely (fallback)
NEXT_WEBPACK_USE_POLLING=true

# Increase HMR timeout
WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_TIMEOUT=60000
```

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The development server has been restarted with the new configuration and is running normally.
